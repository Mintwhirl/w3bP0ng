- Specular highlights on interactive elements
- Smooth morphing animations (CSS + GSAP)
- Dynamic color refraction

**Synthwave Nostalgia:**
- Neon gradients (purple, pink, cyan)

- 80s-inspired typography

**Fusion Result:**
Modern futurism meets nostalgic warmth - a unique, memorable visual identity.

### Ethical Engagement Design
**Remove Manipulative Mechanics:**
- ❌ XP bars and level progression (fake progress)
- ❌ "Achievement unlocked" spam (manipulation)
- ❌ Time-gated rewards (dark pattern)

**Add Respectful Features:**
- ✅ Skill mastery tracking (real improvement charts)
- ✅ Cosmetic unlocks (earned through play, not grind)
- ✅ Personal bests (celebrate genuine achievements)
- ✅ Anti-addiction nudges:
  - After 30 min: "Great session!"
  - After 60 min: "Consider taking a break"
  - Never blocks play, just gentle reminders
