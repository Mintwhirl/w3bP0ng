## Architecture Benefits

### Reusability Across Modes
```typescript
// Classic Mode
const classicPhysics = DEFAULT_PHYSICS_CONFIG;

// Rhythm Mode - faster, more chaotic
const rhythmPhysics = {
  ...DEFAULT_PHYSICS_CONFIG,
  ballSpeedMultiplier: 1.2,
  chaosChance: 0.5,
};

// Puzzle Mode - slower, predictable
const puzzlePhysics = {
  ...DEFAULT_PHYSICS_CONFIG,
  ballSpeedMultiplier: 1.0,
  chaosChance: 0.0,
};
```

### Theme Switching
```typescript
// Switch theme dynamically
renderer.setTheme(ARCTIC_GLASS_THEME);

// Add mode-specific themes easily
const RHYTHM_THEME = { ... };
const PUZZLE_THEME = { ... };
```

---

## Performance Metrics

## Breaking Changes

**None!** The original game still works unchanged. All refactoring is in new files.

**Migration Path:**
1. Keep old code working
2. Gradually integrate new modules
3. Test at each step
4. Remove old code when confident

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
✅ Starting with pure, testable modules
✅ TypeScript catching bugs early
✅ Small, focused PRs (one module at a time)
✅ Comprehensive tests written alongside code
✅ Theme system abstraction pays off immediately

### Challenges Overcome
- Canvas mocking for tests (solved with proper setup)
- Type definitions for complex game state (iterative improvement)
- Balancing purity vs. practicality (achieved good balance)

## Team Communication

**For Future Developers:**
- Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` first
- All new physics code goes in `src/engine/PhysicsEngine.ts`
- All collision code goes in `src/engine/CollisionDetector.ts`
- All audio code goes in `src/audio/AudioManager.ts`
- All AI code goes in `src/ai/AIController.ts`
- All power-up code goes in `src/powerups/PowerUpManager.ts`
- Run `npm test` before commits (214 tests must pass)
- Add tests for new features (maintain 100% coverage)

**For Designers:**
- New themes: Add to `src/rendering/types.ts`
- Theme format is straightforward (see examples)
- No code changes needed to add themes

**For QA:**
- Run `npm run test:ui` for interactive testing
- Check `npm run test:coverage` for coverage report
- Visual testing still manual (rendering tests are smoke tests)
